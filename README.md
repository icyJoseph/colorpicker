# Machine Learning in the Browser

## Color Picker

This project uses [Brain.js](https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js/tree/develop/src). The user can select 5 pairs of colors, `{background-color, font-color}`, and train a Neural Network.

Once the training is done the user can change the background color and `test` a suggested font-color.
