## Map Temperature to Color

This project uses [Brain.js](https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js/tree/develop/src).

The user can select `{temperature, color}` pairs which are used to train a Neural Network.

The temperature ranges from -50 degrees celsius to 50 degrees celsius.

Once the training is done the user can select different temperatures and see which color the Neural Network associates with it.

The user can also see and copy the function built by the Neural Network. This function is already scaled and ready to take temperatures from -50 degrees celsius to 50 degrees celsius.
